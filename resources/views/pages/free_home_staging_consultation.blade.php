                        <h3>Home Staging Is A Proven Way To Add Up To 10% To The Value Of Your Property</h3>
                        <p style="margin-top: 20px;">This leads to a much quicker sale or let. Home staging paves the way for better presentation and – along with professional photos – has a direct impact on Rightmove click through rates. The greater the number of clicks, the higher the number of viewings, which can ultimately lead to a faster sale or let at a higher price.</p>
                        <p>For lettings, well presented properties attract the best tenants, who tend to look after them better.</p>
                        <p>Even if you are not moving home, there are many ways in which our home staging consultation can help you make the best use of your property. You may just be wanting advice on how to reorganise and style your home, implement clever storage or inspire you to channel your inner Marie Kondo and finally get round to decluttering. There’s a reason why the Japanese doyenne of decluttering has sold millions of copies of her books.</p>
