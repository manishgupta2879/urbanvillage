                    <p>I first became an Estate Agent in 1992 and have loved it ever since. Having run 10 successful sales offices around London for a great independent agency for over 15 years, in 2015 I decided to open my own agency. My passion lies in providing excellent customer service coupled with excellent value for money - in my eyes, the whole point of choosing an estate agent is to feel confident that you will achieve the best price, enjoy stress free service, and be on the receiving end of friendly and assertive communication throughout the whole process. Those are the values that I started my agency with and that will forever underpin the ethos of Urban Village. I have two funny, gorgeous children, a supportive and very patient husband, and a little fuzzy dog. I love cycling; hence the pink bikes and I am part of the UK Peloton ladies crew. I also love gardening, walks, seafood and wine!</p>

                    <p>I started my career in the police force in Lambeth which funnily enough laid the groundwork for my career as an Estate Agent at Urban Village as I grew very familiar with the local area. After leaving the police I travelled around South East Asia doing a lot of scuba diving and working at an Orangutan rehab centre in Borneo. On my return to London, I spent several years working as a boxing coach at a local boxing gym - Miguel's - it was here that I met Suzanne, her husband James and I trained them both for a number of years. The rest, as they say, is history. I love being an Estate Agent and the freedom that the job gives me. When I’m not in the office dealing with enquiries, agreeing deals, or seeing sales through to completion, I'm always out and about on my company bike meeting new people and building relationships when conducting valuations and viewings.</p>

                    <p>I’m a true veteran in the property industry, before joining Urban Village in March 2020 - yes, the very start of lockdown - I spent the previous 5 years as Head of Property Management running a large department of 50 property managers and before that I spent 11 years at a large independent agent running three of their sales offices. When I’m not fixing problems with tenants or liaising with landlords in my role as Property Manager at Urban Village, you can find me on the netball court - I play for a local netball team weekly - and am an avid horse rider. I own a beautiful horse called Alan. I've been happily married for 20 years (and been together for over 30!) and have a wonderful daughter.</p>

                    <p>I have happily worked at Urban Village for the last three years, eagerly learning all I can from Suzanne and Sarah. I am a true local, I grew up on Finsen Road in Ruskin Village where my parents still live and have been running amok in Ruskin Park for many years, which happens to be my favourite out of all the parks in London. I am most likely to be found in the Nunhead Gardener in Camberwell choosing the newest addition to my incredibly large plant family, drinking coffee, and eating a vegan sausage roll in Sesami in Herne Hill, running to catch a train at Denmark Hill station or pottering through the Herne Hill farmers market eagerly eyeing up all the goods on offer. I’m responsible for all the virtual property tours at Urban Village and I hope to be visiting you either on screen or in your home very soon!</p>

                    <p>Having grown up in South East London and living locally my whole life, I can honestly say how much I love the local area and the community. I studied History at University and am very interested in local architecture and public spaces. I’ve been at Urban Village for almost 2 years, and I’ve thoroughly enjoyed every moment. I hadn’t worked in an Estate Agency before, but I have learned so much about the property market since. It’s a passion that combines my interest in property, architecture, and history with my love for customer service and makes my role at Urban Village as a Sales Negotiator, a dream job!</p>

My background is within the Entertainment industry where I have over 16 years of experience as a Talent Agent, recruiting and managing the careers of performers across theatre, film, TV and radio. I have always had an interest in property and interiors so the opportunity to join Urban Village as a Sales Negotiator was the perfect scenario. Coming from a boutique talent agency I feel more at home in an independent organisation. I love dinners with friends, spending time with my girls, Mediterranean holidays, cooking, walking and of course, good food!</p>

Jordan’s brilliant initiative and service record in property make him a dream to work with for landlords and tenants alike. "I started in Manchester and then moved to London and worked with overseas investors into new-build developments. I was attracted to Urban Village because after meeting the team and the founder Suzanne, I could tell they had the same ethos as me, that they all actually care about the community and simply enjoyed helping others find their perfect move. Urban Village is different because we care about helping people with the sales/purchasing process. When you get a kick from something, you will usually do it well and as often as possible, and the team here really gets a kick from helping you sell or buying a house."</p>

Any visitors are greeted with a big wag of the tail and demands to be stroked and fed treats. Belly rubs are his favourite.
